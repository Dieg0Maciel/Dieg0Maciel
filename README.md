## About

I am a postdoctoral fellow at The Brazilian Center for Research in Physics (CBPF).

My work on research is focused in problems associated with complex systems, quantization, quantum information and quantum complexity.

The study of information and complex system has sparked my interest in creating practical solutions for data-driven problems, for this purpose I'm currently working on personal projects related to Data Engineering and Data Analysis.

I also enjoy doing some LeetCode problems in my spare time.

``Skills: PYTHON / CYTHON / C++`` 

## Personal Projects

* [ETL PIPELINE WITH PYTHON AND AIRFLOW](https://github.com/Dieg0Maciel/etl_pipeline_with_python_and_airflow): In this project an ETL pipeline was built on premise with Airflow running in a Docker container, where each task is organized and automated by an Airflow DAG.
