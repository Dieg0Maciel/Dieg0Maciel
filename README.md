## About

I am a postdoctoral fellow at The Brazilian Center for Research in Physics (CBPF).

My work on research is focused in problems associated with complex systems, quantization, quantum information and quantum complexity.

The study of information and complex system has sparked my interest in creating practical solutions for data-driven problems, for this purpose I'm currently working on personal projects related to Data Engineering and Data Analysis.

I also enjoy doing some LeetCode problems in my spare time.

``Skills: PYTHON | CYTHON | C++`` 

## Personal Projects
* [TIME SERIES FORECAST WITH SCIKITLEARN](https://github.com/Dieg0Maciel/time_series_forecast_with_scikitlearn/tree/main): Forecast the average temperature in Austin Texas with SciKit-Learn using the Austin Weather dataset provided by Kaggle.

* [ETL PIPELINE WITH PYTHON AND AIRFLOW](https://github.com/Dieg0Maciel/etl_pipeline_with_python_and_airflow): Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) pipeline  built on premise with Airflow and PostgresQL running in a Docker container.

* [NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF SAMPLE SPACE REDUCING PROCESSES](https://github.com/Dieg0Maciel/cascadeSSRP):  Numerical simulation of a Cascade Sample Space Reducing Process implemented in Python and C++. 

* [LEETCODE PROBLEMS](https://github.com/Dieg0Maciel/LeetCode): Solutions for LeetCode problems coded in Python, C/C++.
